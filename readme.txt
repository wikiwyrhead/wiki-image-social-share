== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What Share This Image plugin do? =

Share This Image ( STI ) is an image sharing plugin for WordPress. The main difference between this plugin and many other social sharing plugins is that STI specializes in image sharing and shares exactly selected images with fully customizable content like title, description and URL.
Here is a list of some main plugin features:

* Exact image sharing.
* Fully customizable url, image, title and description that you want to share.
* Supports all most popular social networks/messengers.
* Choose what images on what pages to share.
* and many more...


= What are the requirements to use Share This Image? =

Share This Image is a plugin for self-hosted WordPress sites, or wordpress.com hosted sites that allow installation of third party plugins.
Share This Image requires the following at minimum to work properly:

* WordPress 4.0 or greater
* WooCommerce 3.0.0 or greater
* PHP 5.5 or greater
* MySQL 5.6 or MariaDB 10.0 or greater
* Apache or Nginx server (recommended, but other options may work as well)

= Is it work with my theme/plugin? =

Plugin will work with most of the available WordPress themes. And it also was tested with the most popular WordPress plugins. If yo still faced any problems using the plugin please plugin [contact support]

= What is the steps to make this plugin works on my site? =

In order to start showing plugin sharing buttons you need to take the following steps:
1. Install and activate the Share This Image plugin.
2. Check the plugin settings page. 
3. Check display rules. With these special options it is possible to choose what images on what pages must be available for sharing.
4. Set sharing button. Enable/disable sharing buttons that must be visible on your site. 
5. Finish! From now sharing buttons must work on selected pages ( based on current display rules ).

= Can I enable image sharing only for certain pages or images? =



= What about mobile devices support? =

Sharing buttons works great on both desktop and mobile devices. Optionally you can disable mobile sharing by opening the plugin settings page and turning off Enable on mobile? option.
By default on mobile instead of a sharing button block you will see one sharing icon that will show a sharing button when clicking on it. But this behaviour can be changed.

= Can I change the styles for sharing buttons? =

Yes. With the PRO plugin settings you can choose from several pre-defined sharing buttons styles or change styling for each button individually.

= How can I customize what url, image, title and description to share? =

When sharing new image for title and description plugin first of all looks in 'data-title' and 'data-summary' attributes of image.

So you can set your fully customizable content by adding this attributes. It's can look like that:

`<img src="images/youre-cool-image.jpg" data-title="Title for image" data-summary="Description for image">`

If image doesn't have data attributes then plugin will use title attribute for title and attr attribute for summary.

`<img src="images/youre-cool-image.jpg" title="Title for image" attr="Description for image">`

If image doesn't have data, title and attr attributes then will be used default title and description that you set in the plugin settings page.

Also it is possible to set shared image that can be different from image in the 'img' tag.

It's can be done with help of 'data-media' attribute:

`<img src="youre-image-to-display-on-page.jpg" data-media="youre-image-to-share.jpg">`

Also you can change shared link.

By default plugin will share link to the page where your shared image in situated. But you can simply change this behavior.

Just add 'data-url' attribute with link that you want to be shared.

`img src="images/youre-cool-image.jpg" data-url="http://your-link.com">`

With the PRO plugin version you have the more advanced features in content customization. You can set priority for content sources, use special text variables and even customize sharing content individually for each sharing button.

= How to use plugins build-in shortcode? =

Most common there is no need to use shortcode. Plugin will automatically work with all images that you have on your site.

But with shorcode it is very simple to share desired image with custom title and description.

All you need to do is add this shortcode inside your page or post content section

`[sti_image image="http://your-image-to-display.jpg" shared_image="http://your-image-to-share.jpg" shared_title="Your-title" shared_desc="Your-Description"]`

It is very simple and don't need additional explanation.

= Is it works only with 'img' tag? =

No.

Plugin give ability to run it not only for images, but for any blocks of content.

Only one condition - this block must have data-media attribute with link to shared image.

For example - we have block with custom content inside. This block has class shared-box. So it is very easy to add sharing content for it.

`<div class="shared-box" data-media="images/youre-cool-image.jpg" data-title="Title for image" data-summary="Description for image">
   Youre custom content ( text, html or any other )
</div>`

Don't forget, that class name of block must be specified in plugin selector option. For example, if we want to share all images and this block then selector will be img, .shared-box.

That's all! After this if any of your visitors hover on block with class name shared-box he will see appeared share box with social buttons.

= I install this plugin on my local server and have issues with sharing images. What's wrong? =

In order to share images and all other data social networks must scrap data from you website page. So if your website is not publicly available data will not be scraped.

= Sharing buttons are not visible on my page. What to do? =

There are many reasons that can lead to such an issue. Please follow these steps that can help you with solving the problem.

* Open plugin settings page and find **Minimal width** and **Minimal height** options. Make sure that they are bigger enought overwise sharing will not work for some of your site images.
* Check **Buttons position** option and if it is set to **On image ( always show )** then change it to **On image ( show on mouse enter )**.
* Check the **Display rules** option and make sure that you have proper display conditions for the sharing button.
If your problem is still there - please ask your question on support forum.

= Sharing buttons not visible for my gallery/grid? What to do? =

Problem with the plugin like image galleries or grids is that they load its content dynamically and use JavaScript code for this. The Share This Image plugin works great with many of such types of plugins but sometimes the issues can still appear. In this case please try following steps:

* Open the plugin settings page and check **Buttons position** option. If it is set to **On image ( always show )** then change it to **On image ( show on mouse enter )**.

* This steps requires some coding skills. The trick is to recall sharing buttons display method after the gallery/grid images are fully loaded.
Than just use following JavaScript code:

`$("img").sti();`

The trick here is to call that method only after the gallery/grid images are loaded. Usually such plugins have some JS triggers that are activated after the full load. So you need to know it and then the final code will looks like that:

`$(document).on("custom-event-name", function(){
    window.clearTimeout(timeoutID);
        timeoutID = window.setTimeout( function() {
        $("img").sti();
    }, 1000 );
});`

= Sharing buttons shares default page content and not the one that I selected. How to fix it? =

There are several reasons for this. Please walk through the steps below.
Note: after each step you need to clear your browser cache and the cache of any active caching plugin on your website.

* Open the plugin settings page and find **Use intermediate page** option. Change its value and check if something was changed.

* Make sure that your website is open for indexing: open **Settings** -> **Reading** page and find **Search engine visibility** option.

* Use tools like [Facebook debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) or [Twitter card validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator) to check what actual sharing data social networks sees. This information can help you figure out what goes wrong.
